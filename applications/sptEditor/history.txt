HISTORY of Scenery Editor
==========================

Version 1.x
------------

The first native Scenery Editor for MaSzyna project was founded
in 2004 and was called jET. It was based on Java Runtime. Finally
only beta version was released and due to lack of time project died.

Version 2.x
------------

A few years later in 2008 I started new version of jET from the scratch.
As previously I relied on Java runtime. However it never dawned.

Version 3.0.0
--------------

This is the most recent version of scenery editor, named shortly EI07.
It has been written using Python and used wxWidgets as UI library.
Unlike old versions it is a part of official SPT project.
